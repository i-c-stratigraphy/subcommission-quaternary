## GELSTRAT Continuing re-investigation of the GSSP Gelasian (and lower Pleistocene Subseries, Pleistocene series, Quaternary System) ##
The GELSTRAT group has achieved significant progress over the past three years, particularly in isotopic stratigraphy and studies of marine calcareous microorganisms, with several important findings already published. By the end of 2025, further results are anticipated, including the completion of the pollen record and ongoing dinocyst analyses. Additionally, studies on Beryllium (Be) and paleomagnetism in the type-section are planned for 2025. 
The group's current status will remain unchanged for at least that year. The potential formation of a Working Group on the Gelasian GSSP will be evaluated based on the outcomes of these Be and paleomagnetic studies.
