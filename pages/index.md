        <h2>About the SQS</h2>
        <p>The Subcommission on Quaternary Stratigraphy (SQS) is a constituent body of the <a href="https://stratigraphy.org">International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS)</a>, the largest scientific organisation within the <a href="http://www.iugs.org">International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS)</a>.</p>
        <p>The SQS exists to promote and co-ordinate international co-operation and integration by applying the statutary scientific goals of the ICS to the Quaternary â€“ the most recent geological system, the last 2.6 Ma:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>the establishment and publication of a standard and global geological time-scale for the Quaternary and the preparation and publication of global correlation charts,</li>
            <li>the unification of regional chronostratigraphical nomenclature by organising and documenting stratigraphical units on a global scale,</li>
            <li>the promotion of education in stratigraphical methods, and the dissemination of stratigraphical knowledge,</li>
            <li>the evaluation of new stratigraphical methods and their integration into a multidisciplinary stratigraphy, and</li>
            <li>the definition of principles of stratigraphical classification, terminology and procedure and their publication in guides and glossaries.</li>

<h3>Collaborations</h3>  
        <p>SQS closely collaborates with the <strong>International Union for Quaternary Research (INQUA)</strong> to address the stratigraphic needs of the global Quaternary community. Partnerships include:</p>
            <li><strong>SACCOM</strong>: ongoing collaboration,</li>  
            <li><strong>SEQS</strong>: active collaboration since late 2024.</li>  
        </ul>
