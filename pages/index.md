## About the SQS

The Subcommission on Quaternary Stratigraphy (SQS) is a constituent body of the <a href="https://stratigraphy.org">International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS)</a>, the largest scientific organisation within the [International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS)](http://www.iugs.org).

The SQS exists to promote and co-ordinate international co-operation and integration by applying the statutary scientific goals of the ICS to the Quaternary â€“ the most recent geological system, the last 2.6 Ma:

* the establishment and publication of a standard and global geological time-scale for the Quaternary and the preparation and publication of global correlation charts,
* the unification of regional chronostratigraphical nomenclature by organising and documenting stratigraphical units on a global scale,
* the promotion of education in stratigraphical methods, and the dissemination of stratigraphical knowledge,
* the evaluation of new stratigraphical methods and their integration into a multidisciplinary stratigraphy, and
* the definition of principles of stratigraphical classification, terminology and procedure and their publication in guides and glossaries.

### Collaborations

SQS closely collaborates with the <strong>International Union for Quaternary Research (INQUA)</strong> to address the stratigraphic needs of the global Quaternary community. Partnerships include:

* **SACCOM**: ongoing collaboration,
* **SEQS**: active collaboration since late 2024.
