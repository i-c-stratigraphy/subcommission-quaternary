**AIQUA – Italian Association for Quaternary Research** announces a competition for the assignment of TWO AWARDS 1 to support the participation of early career researchers to the XIX INQUA Congress (Nagoya, Japan, 27 July – 2 August 2015)

The call is open to untenured researchers, scholarship holders and research fellows. One award is reserved to researchers holding Italian nationality. Each prize will be awarded to the first author (who must be also corresponding author) of the best work submitted for publication in the AIQUA journal, AMQ – Alpine and Mediterranean Quaternary, and presented at the 2015 INQUA Congress (either oral or poster communication).

The paper should concern the Quaternary history (climate, biodiversity, sea level change, human-environment interaction) and evolution of the Mediterranean Basin and surrounding regions. Each prize consists in a bonus of up to € 1500 to cover documented costs of participation to the INQUA Congress (e.g. flight tickets, congress registration, accommodation). The winners will be selected on the basis of the evaluation of papers submitted to AMQ by a jury, composed by the editor-in-chief of AMQ and two members of the international geoscientific community.

For registration submit title and abstract to : <adele.bertini@unifi.it>  
For further information please contact: <amq@aiqua.it> or <andrea.sposato@cnr.it>  

1. Both awards are reserved to AIQUA members (AIQUA receives affiliation requests from candidates).
2. If none of the resented works will be judged eligible, the prize will be re-assigned for the next relevant international conference (e.g. IGC, EGU, AGU).

**Deadlines:**  
* September 30th 2014 submission of title + abstract
* October 31th 2014 AIQUA communication of acceptance
* December 31th 2014 submission of the manuscript to AMQ
* February 28th 2015 communication of results
