Dear Professor Finney

I am writing with regard to my position as 
Secretary of the Geological Society Stratigraphy 
Commission. As you are aware, the Commission has 
had a long-standing interest in the status of the 
Quaternary, notably led through Phil Gibbard and 
the former chair Jan Zalasiewicz. The Commission 
have compiled a letter emphasising our position, 
see attached. I also include a couple of recently 
published papers produced by the Commission, for 
your information.

Kind regards

Colin
