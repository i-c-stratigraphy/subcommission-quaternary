Subject: outcome SNS voting

Dear Stan,

Please find attached the outcome of the formal 
voting by SNS voting members on the Neogene and 
Quaternary proposals. Summarizing 65% of the 
votes (of the total of voting members) were in 
favour of the Neogene proposal and 70% against 
the Quaternary proposal. These percentages 
increase to 76.5 and 87.5% if they are calculated 
relative to the number of members that actually 
voted (3 / 4 members did not vote).

There is thus a vast majority of votes in favour 
of the Neogene proposal and against the 
Quaternary proposal. Two members (Agusti and Beu) 
are in favour of the Quaternary proposal (with 
one being against the Neogene proposal). Finally 
there are two votes (Gladenkov and Vai) against 
both proposals. These votes should be interpreted 
as in favour of the status quo (see also their 
comments).

I combined the comments that I received in a 
single pdf file. These comments of both voting 
and non-voting members are rather limited because 
the arguments were I guess rather clear. Note 
that I put the comment of Peter Smolka in a 
separate file because it is rather long and more 
difficult to follow.

I also attach a pdf file with a compilation of 
supporting letters for the Neogene case. Note 
that we preferred to ask only a limited number of 
scientists who are renowned in their field (Earth 
System history, vertebrate and human evolution, 
and magnetic reversal history) rather than to 
have a long list of names of individual 
scientists supporting the original Neogene.

Finally, I attach, as discussed before, our 
response to the Quaternary proposal to be 
distributed among ICS voting members.

Of course I am curious to know how you will 
exactly proceed with the voting procedure. One of 
the problems as discussed earlier and outlined 
especially by Yuri Gladenkov is the lack of a 
proposal for the third "status quo" option. Such 
a third proposal would probably not have had much 
influence on the outcome of the current voting. 
However it might be an idea to include this 
option in the next round by stating that two 
times NO is a (formal?) vote for the status quo. 
This third option has support from some members 
and national committees. However in that case it 
should be clearly stated what is meant by status 
quo, and I am afraid that it will only result in 
a further delay of solving this deep-rooted 
naughty problem.

Good luck,
Frits


PS1. I can send you the individual votes if you wish so.

PS2. I assume that you received the Aubry et al. 
ms from Marie for distribution among ICS voting 
members.
