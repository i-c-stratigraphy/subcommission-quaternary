Dear Stan,

Thanks for your message in which you asked for a response to the letter from Mme Aubry, but we cannot embark on a lengthy discussion of the term Tertiary at present.  Our proposal concerns the Quaternary/Pleistocene and we don't want any distractions from this point.  The topic of the status of the Tertiary is an important matter, and certainly one on which we have an opinion (cf. attached article), but this has no effect on the duration of the Quaternary/Pleistocene.

Could you please remind Aubry and the others that the status of Quaternary as a Period/System is not for debate..

Thanks,

Phil
