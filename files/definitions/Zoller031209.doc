Subject: Quaternary Proposal

Dear Stanley,

as chairman of the INQUA focus group on loess and 
paleopedology, I strongly support the "Quaternary 
proposal". Since many decades geological and 
geomorphological textbooks state that typical 
loess is a sediment relating to glaciations in 
the northern hemisphere. The onset of loess, e.g. 
in China, is at ca. 2.6 Ma and, thus, coeval with 
other - including palaeobiological - world-wide 
proofs of climatic detorioration.

Best regards,
Ludwig
