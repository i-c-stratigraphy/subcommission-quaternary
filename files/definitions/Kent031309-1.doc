Dear Stan:

A recent statement entered into the debate from a prominent 
micropaleontologist:


"I have taught Micropaleontology in Milano and elswhere for more than 
25 years, I have served as shipboard paleontologist (7 DSDP-ODP 
legs), as co-chief scientists in the Pacific, as a member of the 
Ocean History Panels for two mandates, and I can testify that never 
the Neogene extended to the Present. Time scale used always included 
the Quaternary as the last (youngest) subdivision."

is rather surprising considering that some of the most widely cited 
Cenozoic time scale papers (collectively ~2500 citations) published 
over the past 35 years have had the Neogene extended to the Present, 
i.e.,

Berggren, W.A., and Van Couvering, J.A., 1974, The Late Neogene: 
Biostratigraphy, Geochronology and Paleoclimatology of the last 15 
million years in marine and continental sequences: Palaeogeography, 
Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology, v. 16, p. 1-216. [309 citations]

Berggren, W.A., Kent, D.V., Flynn, J.J., and Van Couvering, J.A., 
1985, Cenozoic geochronology: Geological Society of America Bulletin, 
v. 96, p. 1407-1418. [657 citations]

Berggren, W.A., Kent, D.V., Swisher, C.C., and Aubry, M.P., 1995, A 
revised Cenozoic geochronology and chronostratigraphy, in Berggren, 
W.A., Kent, D.V., Aubry, M.-P., and Hardenbol, J., eds., 
Geochronology, Time Scales and Global Stratigraphic Correlations, 
SEPM Special Volume 54: Tulsa, OK, SEPM (Society for Sedimentary 
Geology), p. 129-212. [1229 citations]

Lourens, L.J., Hilgen, F.J., Shackleton, N.J., Laskar, J., and 
Wilson, D., 2004, The Neogene period, in Gradstein, F.M., Ogg, J.G., 
and Smith, A.G., eds., A Geologic Time Scale 2004: Cambridge, 
Cambridge University Press, p. 409-440.

Such long established usage in the literature should be taken into 
account in considering a change in nomenclature.

Cheers,
Dennis
